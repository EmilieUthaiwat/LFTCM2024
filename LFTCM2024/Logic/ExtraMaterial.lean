import LFTCM2024.Logic.Demo

/- To-do:
- classical logic, by_contra, push_neg - ideally I'll cover these in the
talk, provided I have time
- an explanation of implicit/explicit arguments?
- explanation that using lemmas from the library is like using local hypotheses
- ext explanation, induction explanation? maybe
- exercises -/
